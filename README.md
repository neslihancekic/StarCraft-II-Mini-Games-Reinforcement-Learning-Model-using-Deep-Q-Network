# StarCraft-II-Mini-Games-Reinforcement-Learning-Model-using-Deep-Q-Network

Starcraft II is a real time strategy game and the aim of this
game is to create an army to expand the base and destroy the
opponent. It is a fast-paced game that requires the player to
make hundreds of decisions and micro-actions every minute.
With the limited observation area and feature richness in
the game, it is a very good environment for developing a
reinforcement learning model.
In this paper, using the StarCraft II learning environment,
the sub-problems in the game were tried to be solved with
the mini games in the PySC2 library. A model was created
for each selected mini game by training agents with the Deep
Q-Network function in the Ray library.
